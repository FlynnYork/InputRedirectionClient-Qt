# InputRedirectionClient-Qt
Input redirection client for the 3DS using QtGamepad

Supported platforms:

* Windows (via xinput, if you don't have a Xbox controller you should use x360ce)
* Linux (via evdev)
* OSX
* maybe others?

If you have multiple controllers connected at the same time, this software will combine their inputs.
